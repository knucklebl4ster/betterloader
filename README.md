# Lazo's Better Loader!
After making my [Better Bandit](https://thunderstore.io/package/Lazobyota/LazosBetterBandit/) skins, I decided I'd take a crack at Loader, too. So, here it is!

Better Loader comes with two **remodeled loader skins** that specifically focus on making Loader herself less of a twig with a big head and more of an actual person with muscle.

## Unionized

## Future Plans
None right now, but that may change :)

## Credits
Shoutout to KingEnderbrine for the skinbuilder, Roilz for getting me the mech trimsheets, and the modding server for assisting me with some of the mesh issues I was having!
